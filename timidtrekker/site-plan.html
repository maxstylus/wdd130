      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Every homeschooling parent knows that homeschooling has very little to do with schooling at home. We know that the best education does not happen at a desk at all, but rather as we engage in everyday living, in exploring and studying the world around us and as we engage in our communities, develop relationships and experience everyday living. 

        Despite knowing this, too many homeschooling parents get stuck at home while schooling. This is often because parents have forgotten the value and joy of learning through our environment and through experiences and aren’t informed of the many options and opportunities that exist around them. 
        </p>  


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This is a website that will serve as a “friend” or a resource to connect homeschoolers with local activities and opportunities that will bring joy and play back into the homeschoolers educational journey. </p>

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Every homeschooling parent knows that homeschooling has very little to do with schooling at home. We know that the best education does not happen at a desk at all, but rather as we engage in everyday living, in exploring and studying the world around us and as we engage in our communities, develop relationships and experience everyday living. 
        The Timid Trekker works hard for you, a potentially timid trekker, to collect information, resources and cost effective opportunities for homeschooling parents. We aim to inspire you to get your child outdoors, learning in your community more and no longer enslaved to their endless workbooks and worksheets.
      </p>
      <p>
        We all know that learning should be joyful. We learn most when we are in a state of play. Yet again and again we teach our students and children in the most tedious and laborious ways possible. All activities can be simply enjoyed for the activity that it is or you can use some of our resources to incorporate some other educational  topics such math, writing, art and music.
      </p> 
      <p>
        We hope that as you and your homeschooler venture out into your community that you will learn to love many aspects of your community as you participate in the activities and adventures in your neighborhood and as you create opportunities to serve, learn and go with your friends and neighbors.
