    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to get people excited about river rafting. There will be inspiring images that entice people to want to join
       in on the fun and adventure of river rafting. The website will introduce people to the various river rafting activities that Dry Oar offers on land and
       on the rapids. It will display camping opportunities, information and resources. The website will allow cusomters to go to one place to be inspired, 
       register for various activities, get information. All financial transactions and booking will be able to be conducted online. The website will also 
       collect customer information and allow Dry Oar to communicate with their customers - if they desire - on future events and promotions. </p>
    <p>The Dry Oar website will be a central online presence that connects the company's many varied social media accounts. Facebook, Twitter and Instragram 
       can all be linked together. Links to all three popular social media platforms from the companies website will allow professional online communication and 
       advertising.</p>
    <p>Beyond River Rafting, the website will also appeal to a person's desire to "get away". The website will promote beautiful natural scenerary and 
       the health benefits of spending time in nature. The website will be able to connect natural resources with our customers looking to "have it all" by getting 
       away, going on adventure and being in nature and on the water.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience for this website will be varied. We are targetting mandy different ages, river rafting abilities, and camping expertise. We will target both those individuals 
      who are fans of spending time in and around water, but also those who only want to be near the water and in nature but not on the water.  
      The website will speak to those who are only wishing to "get away" and spend time peacefully in nature. It will also target those who want to "reset" 
      with an adventure full of memborable moments. The website will display information for our River Rafting enthusiasts of all experience levels. For our more
      advanced River Rafters we will have information on the Rapids. The website will provide booking options for all online shoppers. It will also give more 
      detailed information about how to book and buy tickets in person at the River Rafting Booths. The website will target those who are not clear what they want to do. 
      It will present various opportunities on land, on the water, solo adventures, group adventures, overnight opportunities and activities that only last 
      a couple hours longs. By giving our customers the information that they need to become familiar with all the many possibilities it will assist 
      the customers that aren't sure just want adventure or experience they should choose for themselves. The website will help our customers to know where, 
      how and how much the adventure will cost. </p>
