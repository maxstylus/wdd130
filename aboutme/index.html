    <p>Hello! My name is Lauren.</p>
    <p>I've been married for 21 years. We have 4 kids that keep us busy. 
      My husband and I have decided to return to school together. We have some unfinished goals to complete.
      We are enjoying sharing this journey and being an example to our kids.

      I currently work full time as a Software Developer in Test. I've been in tech for about 25 years now. I'm hoping to gain strong 
      web development and database skills. Eventually, I want to transition to full time development at my work and to teaching. 
    </p>

      My family, job and studies keep me busy. When I have time, I love to go on adventures, throw pots on the pottery wheel, spin wool on the spinners wheel, paint and work in
      the garden. Working with my hands is a nice break from all the time I spend in my head.
